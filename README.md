# Graphql-NodeJS-Test

A Simple Project to learn how Graphql works, using NodeJS's middleware "express-graphql" to integrate http's resquest to Graphql and Babel compiler to write Javascript in OOP format. The project has a mutation to save user in a array and a query to get all the users or just one. There is some example of Graphql's queries in the sample folder inside src.
